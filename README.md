# PWA JATE-Just Another Text Editor

## Description

The motivation behind building this project was to construct code that fits all of the criteria of a progressive web aplication (pwa). 

The 4 criteria of a pwa are:
1. Has an application shell architecture which gives it a fast loading time.
2. A transport layer security which gives the application privacy and data integrity.
3. A service worker which allows the application to function offline.
4. A manifest file that gives home screen access.

This project was build so I could have working code in regards to pwa's that I would be able to reference in the future. This application is a text editor that allows the user to type text on the screen. The text is then saved in an indexedDB. I learned about how a manifest.json file works, how to build a functioning service worker, and optimizing file structure.
